                    <p> Once upon a younger year
                        When all our shadows disappeared
                        The animals inside came out to play
                        Went face to face with all our fears
                        Learned our <em>lessons</em> through the tears
                        Made <em>memories</em> we knew would never fade</p>

                    <p>One day, my father, he told me, <cite> "Son, don't let it slip away"</cite>
                        He took me in his arms, I heard him say
                        <cite>"When you get older, your wild heart will live for younger days
                            Think of me if ever you're afraid"</cite>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        He said, <cite> "One day, you'll leave this world behind
                            So live a life you will <em>remember</em>"</cite>
                        My father told me when I was just a child
                        <cite> "These are the nights that never die"</cite>
                        My father told me
                    </p>

                    <p> <cite> "When thunderclouds start pouring down
                            Light a fire they can't put out
                            Carve your name into those shining <em>stars</em>"</cite>
                        He said, <cite>"Go venture far beyond the shores
                            Don't forsake this <em>life</em> of yours
                            I'll guide you <em>home</em> no matter where you are"</cite></p>
