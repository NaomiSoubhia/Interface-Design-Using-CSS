                <p> Once upon a younger year
                    When all our shadows disappeared
                    The animals inside came out to play
                    Went face to face with all our fears
                    Learned our <em>lessons</em> through the tears
                    Made <em>memories</em> we knew would never fade</p>

                <p>One day, my father, he told me, <cite> "Son, don't let it slip away"</cite>
                    He took me in his arms, I heard him say
                    <cite>"When you get older, your wild heart will live for younger days
                        Think of me if ever you're afraid"</cite>
                </p>

                <p>
                    He said, <cite> "One day, you'll leave this world behind
                        So live a life you will <em>remember</em>"</cite>
                    My father told me when I was just a child
                    <cite> "These are the nights that never die"</cite>
                    My father told me
                    <cite> "When thunderclouds start pouring down
                        Light a fire they can't put out
                        Carve your name into those shining stars"</cite>
                    He said, <cite>"Go venture far beyond the shores
                        Don't forsake this life of yours
                        I'll guide you <em>home</em> no matter where you are"</cite>
                    One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away"
                    When I was just a kid, I heard him say
                    <cite>"When you get older, your wild <em>heart</em> will live for younger days
                        Think of me if ever you're afraid"</cite>
                    He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind
                    So live a <em>life</em> you will <em>remember</em>"
                    My father told me when I was just a child

                    My father told me
