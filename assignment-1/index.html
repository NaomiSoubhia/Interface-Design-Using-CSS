            <p>Once upon a younger year</p>
            <p>When all our shadows disappeared</p>
            <p>
                The animals inside came out to play
                Went face to face with all our fears
                Learned our lessons through the tears
                Made memories we knew would never fade</p>
            <p> One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away"
                He took me in his arms, I heard him say
                "When you get older, your wild heart will live for younger days
                Think of me if ever you're afraid"
                He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind
                So live a life you will remember"
                My father told me when I was just a child
                "These are the nights that never die"
                My father told me
                "When thunderclouds start pouring down
                Light a fire they can't put out
                Carve your name into those shining stars"
                He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores
                Don't forsake this life of yours
                I'll guide you home no matter where you are"
                One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away"
                When I was just a kid, I heard him say
                "When you get older, your wild heart will live for younger days
                Think of me if ever you're afraid"
                He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind
                So live a life you will remember"
                My father told me when I was just a child
                "These are the nights that never die"
                My father told me
                "These are the nights that never die"
                My father told me
                My father told me</p>
